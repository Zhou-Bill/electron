## QA
Q: `yarn upgrade` does not update package.json

A: ref https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2042
```zsh
yarn global add npm-check-updates
ncu -u
yarn install --check-files
ncu -u
```

Q: What to do if the dependencies cannot be downloaded due to network problems

A: ref https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors

First execute the following command to add the mirror, and then use `yarn install` to download the dependencies

```zsh
yarn config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org -g
yarn config set disturl https://npm.taobao.org/dist -g
yarn config set electron_mirror https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/electron/ -g
yarn config set sass_binary_site https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/node-sass/ -g
yarn config set phantomjs_cdnurl https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/phantomjs/ -g
```

if it still does not work, you can try to use `yarn --ignore-optional` to skip the download of optional dependencies
